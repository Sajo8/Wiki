# Getting Started with TwitchTurtle

## What is TwitchTurtle?

TwitchTurtle is a streamlabs-integration system, which lets you accept tips while streaming with [TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol), a fast, easy and private cryptocurrency.  


## For Streamers<a name="stream">

Setting up a wallet as a streamer is a very simple process; go to a login page, sign in with your Twitch/YouTube account and share the address generated. It's that easy!

## For Donators <a name="donate"></a>

Sending a tip to a streamer is a very simple process, basically the same as sending a normal transaction.  
You enter the address, amount, and an optional message; that's it!
